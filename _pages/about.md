Welcome to my personal website!

I am a medical doctor with a strong interest in biomedical research, data science and statistical programming. I gained most of my research experience during my PhD in epidemiology & immunology. I successfully defended my PhD at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) on September 1, 2021.
