Welcome to my personal website!

I am a medical doctor with a strong interest in biomedical research, data science and statistical programming. I gained most of my research experience during my PhD in epidemiology & immunology. I successfully defended my PhD at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) on September 1, 2021.

### R package

I created an R package called [associationstudies](https://github.com/LDSamson/associationstudies). Although the package is still a work-in-progress, it contains useful custom functions to perform association studies using permutation testing. The package also contains functions that help to create summary tables in a publication-ready format. You can try it out (at your own risk) by installing it in R using the following command: `devtools::install_github("LDSamson/associationstudies")`.
