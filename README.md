# Welcome

Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a medical doctor with a strong interest in healthcare research. I gained experience in biomedical data science and statistical programming during my PhD in epidemiology & immunology. 

I defended my PhD successfully at 1 September at the Groningen University.
